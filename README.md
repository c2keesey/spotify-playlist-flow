# spotify-playlist-flow

Personal project intended for me to learn typescript, react, express, node, mongodb.

I am somewhat of a playlist hoarder on Spotify and really enjoy creating curated playlists for a specific vibe. I would also sometimes like to shuffle a larger selection
of music sometimes, so it would be great if I could combine my playlists.

This app is designed to allow you to create heirarchies of playlists such that songs from child playlists "flow" into their parents. This way, you can maintain finely
curated playlists while also having larger playlists comprised of your smaller ones.

This is my first web app and very much a work in progress, so beware of bugs.
